One of the most significant challenges identified in the systematic review is the absence of ontologies capable of representing sewage infrastructure data, particularly as defined in the DWA-M 150 advisory leaflet. The review results clearly indicate a substantial gap in current research concerning the implementation of sewage infrastructure data networks into ontologies. Existing research in this domain tends to focus on ontologies for decision support systems - primarily supporting technology selection for applications such as condition assessment - and examining how water pipe elements impact other urban infrastructure domains.</p>  

<p class="markdown"> To address this critical gap, this thesis proposes a new ontology named M150-Onto, which aims to implement the data elements described in the DWA-M 150 advisory leaflet into an ontological framework.</p>

<p class="markdown">This chapter begins by detailing the methodical development process of M150-Onto, following established ontology engineering principles. It then demonstrates the practical application of the ontology through the integration of exemplary data as individuals within M150-Onto. The subsequent chapter will provide a comprehensive discussion of the results, including potential application areas, implementation examples, and limitations of M150-Onto. This discussion will also explore how existing ontologies analyzed in previous chapters could be integrated with M150-Onto, concluding with an outlook on future developments for the ontology.
