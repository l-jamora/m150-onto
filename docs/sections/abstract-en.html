<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Underground sewage infrastructure maintenance faces challenges due to fragmented, analog asset data, hindering effective real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. While digital twins offer promising technological potential, their practical implementation is constrained by complex data integration challenges. Ontologies emerge as a critical approach to establish data relationships, providing a structured framework for bridging these systemic information gaps.

To address these gaps, this thesis introduces M150-Onto, a novel ontology designed to enhance the data management of sewage infrastructure by aligning with German regulatory frameworks and supporting interoperability among diverse data sources. This work explores an ontological approach with a particular focus on enabling more efficient querying and reasoning capabilities, allowing for advanced data retrieval and automated inference to support sewer infrastructure data management. M150-Onto is developed and tested within Protégé, demonstrating its potential to improve data accessibility, integration, and predictive maintenance strategies. By identifying the strengths and limitations of current ontological frameworks and proposing M150-Onto as a targeted solution, this research contributes to the digital transformation of sewage infrastructure management. The emphasis on efficient querying and reasoning enhances data-driven decision-making and sustainable maintenance strategies, addressing the critical need for improved infrastructure management amidst growing urbanization and environmental pressures.</span>
